# libft
Re-writing some useful libc's functions
```C
int    ft_atoi(char const *nptr)            -> converting a string to a int
void   ft_bzero(void *s, size_t n)          -> filling 's' ptr as an unsigned char by zeros (null)
void   ft_calloc(size_t nmemb, size_t size) -> it's similar to malloc but its filling the ptr with zeros
```
